I figured out that shifting back down to 24b (around line 257 of table_voice.c, or params_adjusted_table_voice.c) 
was causing the volume/levels issues.
commenting that out appears to have fixed the problem!! yeah!

I also changed some of the params (and upper and lower values) in line with multi_voice/params.c and params.h
- i like eParamTypeNote for Hz-type values

Remaining issues:
(1) fine adjustment does not seem to do anything (i dont use fine adjustments so much, but do want to fix this...)
(2) probably sine_table_inc.c should be in external memory? (just declared as const fract32 on line 65...)
(3) maybe create a new function to hold lines 232 to 252(?)
    - dont want to recreate this code for each new voice...

Questions:
(1) is this method less 'expensive' than waves-type wavetable or osc_polyblep method?
(2) can i generate my own 'tables' from samples? (like not just sine, saw, etc.)

surprisingly(!) it does kind of work
but some problems
(1) VERY quiet
    - no sound with base eParam settings
    - need to turn physical out knob on aleph front panel all the way up (a sign of trouble...)
    - need to turn both amps all the way up (to 0)
    - then need to adjust Hz up till start to hear it
			- does go silent at higher frequencies, but probably due to volume issues.

(2) Tune does nothing
    - not that i can tell anyway

(3) amp0 actually controlls Hz(?)
    - this is just weird, but you can mess around with amp0 setting to see what i mean

(4) general oddness
    - since this is a pretty rough hack ( i didnt expect it to work at all)
      i think i am missing some of the nuances
    - the original rawsc actually just appears to cascade the functions, so the 
      equivalent(?) of module_process_frame is not void and recieves the idx from above
      as input
