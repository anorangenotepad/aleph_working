surprisingly(!) it does kind of work
but some problems
(1) VERY quiet
    - no sound with base eParam settings
    - need to turn physical out knob on aleph front panel all the way up (a sign of trouble...)
    - need to turn both amps all the way up (to 0)
    - then need to adjust Hz up till start to hear it
			- does go silent at higher frequencies, but probably due to volume issues.

(2) Tune does nothing
    - not that i can tell anyway

(3) amp0 actually controlls Hz(?)
    - this is just weird, but you can mess around with amp0 setting to see what i mean

(4) general oddness
    - since this is a pretty rough hack ( i didnt expect it to work at all)
      i think i am missing some of the nuances
    - the original rawsc actually just appears to cascade the functions, so the 
      equivalent(?) of module_process_frame is not void and recieves the idx from above
      as input
