WORKS! (2022-05-20)

BUT!
1) svf acting a bit funny (i.e. need to adjust filter cutoff before sound starts...)
2) probably need slew over svf controls (cutoff and rq) to smooth transitions
   (the mix.c example works, but see lines.c, too)
3) i dont really know how to control lines delay... that is a user issue, though.
4) i think this is pushing cpu a bit, so the next item should be working on wavetables
   non-wavetable voices probably eat A TON of cpu...


right now, compiles (2022-05-18)
BUT!
not routed though delay yet!
routing is tricky due to somewhat tricky routing of original lines
