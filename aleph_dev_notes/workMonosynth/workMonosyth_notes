Overview

I had trouble with freezes when trying to use waves to set presets/scenes, so i modified monosynth
(it has less going on, so it does not freeze)



Notes

(20211023)

- It seems like the original monosynth was meant to be controlled by an envelope, BUT i just wanted a 
  basic 1 voice osc to play arround with, so i bypassed myEnv and just sent the output straight to 
  out[0].

- I also figured out that (even though the original used saw_polyblep) you can use square_polyblep
  because square and saw have the same number of inputs (see monosynth.c)
