Overview

i am thinking

	| input | -> |ring mod | -> |output|

OR

	|input 1| -> | ring|
	|input 2| -> | mod | -> |output|
	
	(like using one to mod the other...)

Progress

(20211009)

- basically i used the code from the audio programming book, and it seems to work
  (shows up on the scope)

- i need to set up a parameter to control it though

- i probably need to set up some kind of outBus too (its still pretty rough...)
